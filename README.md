# user-system
A captcha- and token-based user login system as a cornerstone for future projects

The project is divided into the main functionality and the database(s) needed for it to work fully.

Its main specialty would be the customisation of forms. Criteria for new form fields (such as min./max. length, a certain RegEx pattern) can be easily added and stored in /const/rules, and when integrated once and correctly these criteria will be ensured in the front-end as well as in the back-end and can be attached to multiple form fields across the site without having to repeat the criteria for each field ever again.
